            Full stack developer from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, dedicated to
            cooperating and <span>building accessible products.</span> <br />
            In 2022, my coding journey began, learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            on Platzi. Throughout 2023, I had the opportunity of
            <span>working with React, Angular, TypeScript, Node, and SCSS</span
            >, under the guidance of experienced Santex developers as part of
            the company's training program. <br />
            As a <span>native Spanish speaker and fluent in English</span>, I am
            eager to contribute my skills as a frontend & backend developer in a
            collaborative remote team. I thrive on learning new technologies and
            am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge. <br />
